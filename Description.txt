To create this tool I broke the problem into three parts

1: Recognizing file pairs
2: Finding Leaf level xml nodes
3: Drawing boxes around coordinates

I split the tool into three files as each file uses a different imported module and has a different purpose

1: 
The first file is GUICircler.py this is the main/driver code and only contains a main function. It uses the os
module to identify xml/png pairs and then for each pair the code runs the other two files to find leafs and circle them.

2:
the second file is boundsGet.py, this file uses the ElementTree module to find all leaf level nodes and find thier bounds
It first initializes the xml tree, then recursivley finds the leaf level nodes. When it does it finds thier "bounds" attribute
and adds it to a list and once all are found, returns the list.

3:
the third file is boxDraw.py it uses PIL Image and ImageDraw to draw boxes around each leaf item. It takes each item of the 
bounds list and splits it into 4 integers, then draws 4 lines around each item.


I split the code into 3 files as each file serves a different purpose and doesnt need to interact beyond passing a single list.
For troubleshooting this made things easier as I could test each file seperatley and identify errors much easier.
